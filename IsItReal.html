                            <li><p> When you do something good, your brain releases dopamine, 
                                causing you to want to do it again. Dopamine is also how addictions work. 
                                When you see somebody you like, your brain releases dopamine, creating a 
                                desire for more. Depending on how strong this initial sight is, these 
                                feelings may feel like love and is a large player in the science of love at 
                                first sight.</p></li>

                             <li><p> Oxytocin plays a role in controlling your body’s sexual functions and your 
                                 emotions related to them. In terms of “love at first sight,” the hormone plays 
                                 a similar role as dopamine. When you love somebody, oxytocin is large reason in why. 
                                 It is what creates physical desire, or lust, and can be released when you see somebody 
                                 you desire.</p></li>
